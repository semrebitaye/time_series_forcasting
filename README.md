## Task 1: Preprocess and Explore the Data

  ####  1, Data Cleaning & Understanding
Statistics: Compute summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for each column.
Data Types & Missing Values: Confirm the data types and check for any missing values. Handle missing data by interpolation, filling, or removal.
Normalization: Normalize or scale data, especially if using machine learning models, to ensure consistent scales.

#### 2, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Price Trends: Plot the daily closing prices over time for TSLA, BND, and SPY to visually assess any trends or patterns.
Daily Returns: Calculate daily percentage changes and plot to observe volatility.
Volatility Analysis: Use rolling statistics (mean, standard deviation) to assess short-term trends.
Outlier Detection: Detect days with significant price changes to identify anomalies.

#### 3, Seasonality & Trend Analysis
Decomposition: Decompose the time series to separate trend, seasonal, and residual components, which can clarify long-term and cyclical patterns.

#### 4, Volatility & Risk Analysis
Value at Risk (VaR): Calculate VaR for Tesla to estimate potential losses at a chosen confidence level.
Sharpe Ratio: Compute the Sharpe Ratio for Tesla to evaluate risk-adjusted returns.

#### 5, Documentation: 
Summarize findings on Teslaâ€™s overall price direction, fluctuations in returns, VaR, and Sharpe Ratio.
