## Task 1: Preprocess and Explore the Data

### Data Cleaning & Understanding
##### Statistics: Compute summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for each column.
##### Data Types & Missing Values: Confirm the data types and check for any missing values.    Handle missing data by interpolation, filling, or removal.
##### Normalization: Normalize or scale data, especially if using machine learning models, to ensure consistent scales.

###    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)S
#####        Price Trends: Plot the daily closing prices over time for TSLA, BND, and SPY to visually assess any trends or patterns.
#####        Daily Returns: Calculate daily percentage changes and plot to observe volatility.
#####        Volatility Analysis: Use rolling statistics (mean, standard deviation) to assess short-term trends.
#####        Outlier Detection: Detect days with significant price changes to identify anomalies.

###    Seasonality & Trend Analysis
#####        Decomposition: Decompose the time series to separate trend, seasonal, and residual components, which can clarify long-term and cyclical patterns.

###    Volatility & Risk Analysis
#####        Value at Risk (VaR): Calculate VaR for Tesla to estimate potential losses at a chosen confidence level.
#####        Sharpe Ratio: Compute the Sharpe Ratio for Tesla to evaluate risk-adjusted returns.

###    Documentation: Summarize findings on Tesla’s overall price direction, fluctuations in returns, VaR, and Sharpe Ratio.

## Task 2: Develop Time Series Forecasting Models

###    Model Selection & Setup
#####        Select one of the following models:
#####            ARIMA for non-seasonal data.
#####            SARIMA for data with seasonality.
#####            LSTM for long-term dependencies if neural networks are preferred.
#####        Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model validation.

###    Training & Optimization
#####        Train the model on historical data.
#####        Use grid search or auto_arima (for ARIMA models) to tune parameters and find the best fit.
#####        For deep learning models (e.g., LSTM), consider hyperparameter tuning using libraries like Keras or TensorFlow.

###    Evaluation Metrics
#####        Use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to gauge model accuracy.

## Task 3: Forecast Future Market Trends

###    Forecasting
#####        Generate 6-12 month forecasts for Tesla using the trained model.
#####        Include confidence intervals to reflect prediction uncertainty.

###    Forecast Analysis
####        Trend Analysis: Assess long-term trends and note any consistent upward, downward, or stable patterns.
####        Volatility: Examine the confidence intervals to understand periods of higher uncertainty or expected volatility.
####        Opportunities & Risks: Identify potential opportunities (e.g., anticipated price increases) or risks (e.g., increased volatility).

## Task 4: Optimize Portfolio Based on Forecast

###    Constructing a Sample Portfolio
#####        Use a portfolio with Tesla (TSLA), Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND), and S&P 500 ETF (SPY).
#####        Forecast future prices for BND and SPY to build a full picture of the portfolio’s future performance.

###    Combine Data
#####        Consolidate closing prices for TSLA, BND, and SPY into a single DataFrame.
#####        Compute daily and annualized returns.

###    Risk & Return Analysis
#####        Covariance Matrix: Compute covariance to see how returns co-move.
#####        Portfolio Weights: Define weights for each asset, then calculate the weighted average return and portfolio risk (standard deviation).
#####        Sharpe Ratio: Maximize the Sharpe Ratio by optimizing asset weights, using tools like scipy.optimize or cvxpy.

###    Portfolio Optimization
#####        Rebalance allocations to enhance stability (e.g., increasing BND if Tesla’s volatility is high).
#####        Create visualizations to demonstrate portfolio performance based on the forecasted returns.

##    Summary & Visualization
#####        Summarize expected return, risk (volatility), and the Sharpe Ratio.
#####        Document any recommended adjustments to the asset allocation and provide rationale.
#####        Include cumulative return charts and risk-return plots to visually represent portfolio perfoSrmance.
